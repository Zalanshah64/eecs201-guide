# Syllabus

This is a 1-credit hour seminar designed to teach students the essentials of using a computer effectively for EECS students. While the target audience is EE/CE/CS/DS students, any student wishing to learn how to use their computer more effectively is encouraged to join. Students are expected to be familiar with basic concepts of programming, such as control flow (e.g. if-else, loops, functions) and expressing their ideas in program statements. Topics covered include Unix-like systems, shells, version control, build systems, debugging, and scripting. The ultimate goal of the class is to give students hands on experience with the prevailing tools of the trade as well cultivate research skills for picking up new tools in an ever-evolving computing landscape.

## Lectures

Lectures will take place Fridays from 10:30am-12:00pm at [220 Chrysler](https://maps.studentlife.umich.edu/building/chrysler-center-continuing-engineering-education"). Classes will be recorded and available on [Leccap](https://caen.engin.umich.edu/lecrecording/). Alternative to going to classes in-person, a [Zoom link](https://umich.zoom.us/j/93092386157) will be available.

<br/>

Each week, short bite-sized videos will be released in [the schedule tab of the course website](https://www.eecs.umich.edu/courses/eecs201/wn2023/schedule). The class will take the form of a flipped classroom: students can watch the online videos or come to the lecture in person (or both). The first half of each class will review the content of the videos, and the second half will act as a period of time to ask questions or do homework with help of the instructional aides and professor.
