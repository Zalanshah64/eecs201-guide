## Frequently Asked Questions

  - Q: Why can't I log onto the server?
  - A: There could honestly be a million reasons why, but ensure the following:
    - You have [submitted your ssh key](/Server.md#creating-your-ssh-key) correctly
    - If you were able to log on before but are no longer able to, you did not change the location of the `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` or `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` files, and you haven't generated new keys recently
  - Q: Why is `eecs201-test` unable to recieve/clone my submission?
  - A: Ensure your submission has followed [these three steps](/Grading.md#why-not-submitting).
