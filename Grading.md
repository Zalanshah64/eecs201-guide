# Grading

This course utilizes a point-accumulation method whose point sums map to a typical grading scale. That means that there is no averaging of grades: to make the letter grade you want, you simply have to accumulate enough points for it by completing assignments. There are multiple categories of points, and the "adjusted" sum of each category's points is used to determine your final letter grade. Each category may have certain rules on how many points you can earn from them, hence the quoted "adjusted". This will be elaborated in the following sections.

<br/>

## Letter Grades

Final letter grades will be determined by the following scale:
<ul>
    <li>[100, ∞ ): A+</li>
    <li>[93, 100): A</li>
    <li>[90, 93 ): A-</li>
    <li>[87, 90 ): B+</li>
    <li>[83, 87 ): B</li>
    <li>[80, 83 ): B-</li>
    <li>[77, 80 ): C+</li>
    <li>[73, 77 ): C</li>
    <li>[70, 73 ): C-</li>
    <li>[67, 70 ): D+</li>
    <li>[63, 67 ): D</li>
    <li>[60, 63 ): D-</li>
    <li>[0 , 60 ): E</li>
</ul>

<br/>
<br/>

## Basic
Each basic assignment will be worth 6 points in total. Every additional point you earn past 60 points is worth 50%. This means that if you do 12 basic assignments, the number of points you get from the Basic category will be 60 + (12 * 0.5) = 66. Nominally, this means you only have to get full credit on 10 basic assignments to hit the 60 point total. This serves as a built-in buffer for missing/not doing assignments, as there are more than 10 basic assignments in the class. That being said, it is expected that you do each basic assignment as a means to familiarize yourself with a topic.

<br/>

The goal of these assignments is to reinforce concepts introduced in lecture and to give hands-on experience. To emphasize this, your assignment scores will be converted the following way for final grade calculation: what number we report to you will be the raw score. On the left is the raw score and on the right is the adjusted final score.

<ul>
    <li> [6, ∞): Will not be adjusted</li>
    <li> [4, 6): 6</li>
    <li> [2, 4): 4</li>
    <li> [0.5, 2): 2</li>
    <li> [0, 0.5): Will not be adjusted</li>
</ul>


<br/>
<br/>

## Advanced

There are two possible ways to approach the Advanced category. Each weekly advanced assignment is worth 10 points in total, which means you only have to do 4 to meet the category total. Alternatively, you can complete 1 project for 40 points. Projects can be completed for partial credit, though only one project can be used for project credit.

<br/>

Similarly to the Basic category, all points past the category total of 40 points will be worth 50%. For example, if you do every single advanced assignment and get full credit, you will earn 12 * 10 = 120 raw points. The 80 points after the initial 40 points will be worth half: therefore your final Advanced score would be 40 + (80 * 0.5) = 40 + 40 = 80. (If you decide to do all advanced assignments and the project, that's 120 + 40 = 160 raw points, resulting in 40 + (120 * 0.5) = 40 + 60 = 100 Advanced points, netting you a 100 in the class without having to do any basic assignments).

<br/>
<br/>


## Miscellaneous

Each week, one lecture survey and one quiz will be released. Each lecture and quiz will be due by the Friday of its corresponding lecture, and will each earn 1 point. If done after the deadline, quizzes can still be submitted for half-credit (i.e. 0.5 points). Surveys <b>cannot</b> be submitted for partial credit.

## Gradescope and Autograder

Homework assignments will be submitted through one of two methods: <a href="https://gitlab.eecs.umich.edu/">Gitlab</a> or <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/">Gradescope</a>. Gradescope assignments have a hard deadline, but Gitlab assignments are all due at the end of the semester.

Submitting on gradescope is simple enough: answer the questions asked in the homework.

<div name="why-not-submitting"></div>

Assignments submitted via <a href="https://gitlab.eecs.umich.edu/">Gitlab</a> will be pushed up to the server, and then run on <a href="/Server.md">the course server</a>. Everytime you submit, ensure the following three things are true:

<ul>
    <li>Have you correctly named the repository?</li>
    <li>Have you added ```brng``` as a reporter?</li>
    <li>Have you pushed the correct branch up?</li>
</ul>

The following are all assignments, and a guide for where they are submitted:
